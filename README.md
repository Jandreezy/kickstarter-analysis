## Kickstarting with Excel

### Overview of Project
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
### Purpose
Louise's play was close to its funraising goal in a short amount of time and now she would like to see how the other campaigns did in relation to her play's launch dates and funding goals.
### Analysis and Challenge
There were a total of 1047 outcomes for Louise's play spanning from 2010-2017 as well as target goals ranging from $1-$100,000. Since there are over 1,000 different possible outcomes, this requires filtering of the data through goals as well as launch dates.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the line chart above, the most successful year was 2015 with a total of 273 successful kickstarters and the most successful month being May. The worst year being the first year, which is 2011, with only 4 successful kickstarters that year and the worst month being December with more failed outcomes than there were successful ones.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to the line graph based on goals, the lower the goal is, there is a higher chance of having a successful kickstarter. There is a slight variance in the graph as the goal reaches around $25k-45k but overall the trend stays the same throughout the entire graph.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The kickstarter analysis had a wide range of data that needed to be filtered out. For example, the highest goal was $100k and the lowest was below a dollar so that's a very broad spectrum of data in addition to the variations in dates over the course of 7 years.
## Results
The outcomes based on launch date show us that Louise's kickstarters were the most successful in the month of May then tapers down gradually during the fall and winter months. She really needs to focus on kickstarters from May-July because those three months are the only months out of the year that achieve higher than an 80% successful rate. According to the outcomes based on goals, it's best to set the goal lower because after $20k the percentage failed goes above 50% for the most part. I also think that there could be a possibility of more successful kickstarters in the $40-45k goal because 2 out of the 3 kickstarters were successful and every goal above $45k did below 20%. I think the limitations of this dataset is the lack of consistency. There's a lot of variances in all of the data categories that are filtered and I feel that if the numbers were more consistent across the board, we could get a more accurate representation and analysis. A stacked bar graph can also be used in this dataset because all of the data would be side by side and each bar would show the ratio of successful versus unsuccessful.
